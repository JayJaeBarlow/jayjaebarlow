If you want this to match the kajju027 style exactly, I can:
1) Add GitHub stats and visitor counter.  
2) Pin up to 6 repos (tell me 3–6 repo names to pin).  
3) Add a short one-line professional bio at the top instead of the greeting.  

I can push this README to your profile repo once the repo has an initial branch (main) or an initial commit. I couldn't push earlier because the repository was empty — please create the initial commit using one of these options and then reply "done" so I can push the README for you.
