A personal dev & design playground with a synthwave aesthetic. This README includes a neon hero header, synthwave-themed stats placeholders, a project gallery, and useful badges — all easy to customize.

---

## Synthwave Stats

Embed your dynamic GitHub stats below (examples/placeholder images). Replace `USERNAME` with your GitHub username to enable real stats.

- GitHub Readme Stats (example):

  ![GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=JayJaeBarlow&show_icons=true&theme=tokyonight)

  If you prefer a synthwave look, explore community themes or generate a custom theme on the GitHub Readme Stats repo and swap the `theme` query param. Example placeholder (update to a synthwave theme if available):

  ![Synthwave stats placeholder](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=JayJaeBarlow&show_icons=true&theme=react)

- Streak / Contribution (example):

  ![GitHub streak](https://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com/?user=JayJaeBarlow&theme=dark&date_format=%5BY%5Dm%2Fd)

> Tip: To fully match the synthwave look, customize colors in the stats generator or self-host modified assets and point the image src to your custom endpoint.

## Project Gallery

A quick gallery of highlighted projects. Replace placeholders with real images, descriptions and links.

- Example layout (3-column gallery):

| Project | Snapshot | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| Project One | ![proj1](https://via.placeholder.com/300x180.png?text=Project+1) | Short description and features. Link: https://github.com/JayJaeBarlow/project-one |
| Project Two | ![proj2](https://via.placeholder.com/300x180.png?text=Project+2) | Short description and technologies. Link: https://github.com/JayJaeBarlow/project-two |
| Project Three | ![proj3](https://via.placeholder.com/300x180.png?text=Project+3) | Short description and badges. Link: https://github.com/JayJaeBarlow/project-three |

You can replace the placeholder images with actual project screenshots stored in the repo (e.g. `assets/projects/project-one.png`).

## Badges & Quick Links

Add or swap badges with shields.io or other services. Examples:

- Build / CI: `https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/OWNER/REPO/ci.yml?style=for-the-badge`
- Coverage: `https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/gh/OWNER/REPO?style=for-the-badge`
- Issues: `https://img.shields.io/github/issues/OWNER/REPO?style=for-the-badge`

Example badges (replace OWNER/REPO):

[![CI](https://img.shields.io/badge/CI-passing-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)](#)
[![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/Coverage-__%25-orange?style=for-the-badge)](#)
[![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/JayJaeBarlow/JayJaeBarlow?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/JayJaeBarlow/JayJaeBarlow/issues)
